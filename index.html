        <li>
            <strong>Agricultural IoT Security:</strong> Tackling the essential issue of building trust within the framework of developing agricultural IoT network applications. Strategies integrate physical layer features with cryptographic primitives. In a contemporary farm environment, this research creates novel methods that allow secure operations for wirelessly equipped, scalable, and interoperable equipment. This will help reduce significant damage to farm production due to corruption of the sensitive real-time data transmitted and received by Ag-IoT sensors underground to the Over-the-Air actuator during the smart agricultural process. Thereby increasing crop yield by efficiently using human labor and natural resources. Funded by NSF under grants (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2331191" target="_blank">CNS-2331191</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2225161" target="_blank">CNS-2225161</a>, <a href="https://cpn.unl.edu/projects/2G4UG" target="_blank">CNS-1619285</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2030272&HistoricalAwards=false" target="_blank">ECCS-2030272</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Autonomous Vehicle Security:</strong> The development of autonomous vehicles has advanced significantly; unmanned aerial aircraft, driverless cars, and many more are enhancing and securing our way of life. But this also creates a new avenue for attack: an enemy can now seize control of these self-governing devices and create potentially fatal situations. We use trajectory and motion vector data and the Doppler effect to ensure message integrity and authentication of autonomous vehicles. We formally analyze the correctness and robustness of VET using matching conversations. Our experimental tests and evaluations show that our protocol detected and removed adversaries well.

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Radio Frequency Fingerprinting - On-going:</strong> Research on fingerprinting in underground networks for message integrity verification. This offers the cryptographic identities a sort of second-factor authentication. To solve this issue, we identify wireless physical layer characteristics for devices and locations using machine learning methods. Funded by NSF under grants (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2331191" target="_blank">CNS-2331191</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2225161" target="_blank">CNS-2225161</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Molecular Communication Security - On-going:</strong> Research on molecular communication to guarantee message integrity verification. We tackle the challenge of securing nanodevices and sensors that operate in biological environments that are different from conventional electromagnetic environments. To solve this issue, we investigate a lightweight approach to securing the communication between absorbing Alice and Bob nanodevices in the presence of an attacker, Eve, whose main goal is to bootstrap into the molecular channel to cause various harm. We study the various attacks Eve can perform and propose possible ways to secure the molecular channel. This will facilitate efficient drug delivery and nanomedicine and help to prevent bio-terrorism from causing harm to the water and environment.
